#  Shopping Trends Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of shopping trends to explore customer behavior and build predictive models using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc.).

# Dataset

  - Review Rating, Subscription Status
  - Payment Method, Purchase Amount, etc.

# Project Features

- Data Cleaning & Exploration
- Visual Analysis (Age, Gender, Purchase Amount, Category Trends, etc.)
- Feature Engineering
- Target Identification (e.g., predicting `Purchase Amount (USD)` or `Subscription Status`)
- Model Building (e.g., Linear Regression, Classification)
- Result Evaluation (MSE, Accuracy, etc.)
- Interactive App (Optional: via Gradio)
